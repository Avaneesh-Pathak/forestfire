## Introduction

The Forest Fire Prediction project focuses on predicting the occurrence of forest fires using machine learning algorithms. The model utilizes the Forest Fire algorithm, which combines environmental and weather features to determine the likelihood of a forest fire. By analyzing factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rain, the model can provide valuable insights for fire prevention and management.

## Installation

To install and set up the Forest Fire Prediction project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-fire-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd forest-fire-prediction
   ```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the Forest Fire Prediction model:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Prepare a dataset of historical forest fire occurrences with relevant environmental and weather features.
3. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your dataset and requirements.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. After training, the model will be saved to disk for later use.
6. Customize the prediction script `predict_fire.py` to handle new environmental and weather data and load the trained model.
7. Run the `predict_fire.py` script to predict the occurrence of a forest fire:
   ```
   python predict_fire.py
   ```
8. The script will prompt for the relevant environmental and weather features.
9. Based on the provided features, the script will predict and display the likelihood of a forest fire.

## Model Training

To train the Forest Fire Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset of historical forest fire occurrences with corresponding environmental and weather features.
2. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your dataset and preferred machine learning algorithm (e.g., decision tree, random forest, etc.).
5. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
7. Adjust the model or experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve its performance if necessary.

## Dataset

The Forest Fire Prediction model requires a dataset of historical forest fire occurrences with relevant environmental and weather features. Ensure that your dataset contains a diverse set of fire occurrences along with corresponding data on temperature, humidity, wind, rain, etc.

If you don't have a dataset, you can utilize publicly available datasets on forest fires or create your own by collecting and labeling data.

## Results

The Forest Fire Prediction model provides estimations of the likelihood of forest fires based on the provided environmental and weather features. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions depend on the quality and diversity of the dataset, the chosen machine learning algorithm, and the training process.

It is important to note that while the model can provide valuable insights, forest fire occurrence depends on various complex factors. Environmental conditions, human activities, and other variables may impact the occurrence and behavior of forest fires. The model predictions should be used as a tool to enhance fire prevention and management strategies rather than as the sole basis for decision-making.
